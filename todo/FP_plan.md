Code

28th

  - Reoorganise the whole codebase
    - Baseline, beat baseline, overfitting
    - Replicate the paper and get final test accuracy
    - Tune hyperparameters (REMOVE last dense layer)
      - add callbacks
      - different layers and layer size
      - Global Average Pooling/Max or flatten
      - parameters: dropout, Regularizers, epochs, learning rate (L2 at 0.0004)
      - residuals
      - Experiment with data augmentation
      - Experiment with image processing/transformation
    - Train Final proposed BEST Model using train + val and test on test
    - Train Final proposed MOST EFFICIENT Model using train + val and test on test

    - Transfer learning using VTID2 dataset

    - SOTA model using VGG16

  - Ensure it is following ML workflow

29th
  - Finalize above code structure, fix issues if any
  - Experiment with precision and recall and create confusion matrix
  - Check AUCROC curve as metric
  - Experiment with models to get the highest accuracy possible

################################################################################

30th
  - Experiment with models to get the highest accuracy possible
  - Write perfect helper functions
  - Explore datasets output images of what the dataset looks like
    - also put split folders code in this dataset
    - script to automatically download raw folders in data
  - Ensure all notebooks are perfectly formatted and code is commented

31st
  - Get public repo COMPLETED with readme and EVERYTHING ELSE!

  - Rewrite implementation and evaluation (add apple M1 specs on which models ran)

  - Fix report

    1 Fix images and table referencing and linking
      - There should be a figure and table number followed by the caption of the image and table. The figures and tables should be correctly referenced in the text.

    2 Ensure page limit by putting non-essential images and tables below, and writing more concisely.
      - You have exceeded the page limit. Maximum 3 pages are allowed for Implementation and evaluation chapters each. You used 12 pages for implementation and exceeded page limit for evaluation too. You lost marks because of not following the guideline.

    3. Fix references
      - The list of references at the end of the paper should be in numerical order (in the order of citation) if in-text citation by number or in alphabetical order if in-text citation by author-date.

1st

  - Fix report (contd)

    4. Modify design section to increase space for work plan
      - Work plan has not been explained in sufficient detail.

    5. Modify introduction to give overview of whole report to readers
      -Along with the project concept and motivation for choosing the project, Introduction chapter should briefly introduce other chapters to give an overview of the whole report to the reader.

    6. Add table of contents
      A table of contents should be added.

2nd
  - Re-read and proof read report before finalizing it.
  - Make video
